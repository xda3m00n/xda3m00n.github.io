## Overview

In this post I will share my experience with the [Offensive Security's PEN-200 (OSCP) ](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) and provide some useful links that helped me during the labs and the exam itself. 

## My background

I never worked anywhere close to the cyber security field, I was mostly training on sites such as ``Vulnhub``, ``HackTheBox`` and ``TryHackMe``. I started my way somewhere in late 2017 from watching ``JackkTutorials`` on YouTube until I was introduced to ```HackTheBox```. I heard about ``OSCP`` a few months after I joined HTB on the forums, and set it as a milestone for myself.

### The PWK Labs

I signed up for the PWK back in October 2020 with 60 days of lab time. I took around two weeks to go through the PDF and another few days for the videos. I then started doing the machines from the lab, at first I was picking up the easy machines there but quickly faced the harder machines. At the end of the lab time, I had 49 machines done and finished all the available networks (Dev, IT, Admin). I was doing two-three machines a day, but took a lot of breaks during the lab time.

The course materials were amazing, I found them super useful through my time with the machines on the lab. I found a lot of value in them and even though I haven't done the exercises, it was still fun and worth it. 
The machines on the lab are good, some of the machines on the lab were more on the CTF side, but still fun to do them. The chained hosts were a bit confusing for me, so I left them for the end of the lab time. I eventually got into the networks, I had a great time doing them, even though there are some hosts that are not sharing the similarity with the ones I faced on the exam, I still found it to be super challenging and fun. My advice for the labs is to try and enjoy it and if you're stuck on something, it might be worth looking into the course materials before checking the forums for hints.
## The exam itself 

The exam itself was brutal at the beginning, I don't know what happened but it was just tough. I was doing something that I know was easy, but somehow I managed to complicate that. The worst thing that happened was not knowing what was wrong, which gave me a lot of stress. It took me 3 hours to do something I could have done in 40 minutes, just because I was full of stress and didn't realize a mistake I've done all along. Once I managed to get back on track, I moved on to the next machine, which I managed to crack in 4 hours. 7 hours into the exam, I moved on to the easiest machine there and after rooting that, I went to sleep. Woke up 2 hours later and worked on the next machine, which was the last one on my list because that was enough to pass. After 6 hours of work on that machine, I was able to root it and call it a day. I attempted to do the last machine too, but gave up and went to bed knowing I passed. It is super easy to get confused and panic during the exam, it varies from person to person. You should be prepared for that, and find a way to calm yourself, whether it's a walk outside or a cold shower, i don't give a fuck.

## HackTheBox & Prep 
[HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) helped me a lot. Not only for OSCP, but in general. At first, I used HTB as a way to pass the free time I had but eventually, I forced myself to do X machines in a week, sometimes it was 2 machines a week, sometimes 6, it was depending on the available time I had. It helped me in a lot of ways, I became more aware of known CVEs, got the chance to explore new techniques and sharpened my skills in Privilege Escalation, enumeration and Exploit development. Also being a ``VIP`` helped me a lot at the beginning, attacking machines and once getting stuck for quite some time, checking online for solutions was nice - especially watching ``ippsec``'s videos. I never tried to depend on it though. I eventually found the known TJnull's Preparation Guide for OSCP, which helped a lot at the time, doing retired machines could do so much change. I highly recommend to get VIP and work on retired machines.

## TryHackMe & Buffer Overflows
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is another platform that could help a lot here, I found it extremely helpful to practice on Buffer Overflows. I first watched ``The Cyber Mentor``'s playlist on [Buffer Overflows Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSnPayW6F7U&list=PLLKT__MCUeix3O0DPbmuaRuR_4Hxo4m3G) and eventually checked the rooms the ``THM``. The first room I checked was ``Buffer Overflows``, had a very nice explaination there, but I believe it requires you be a premium user. The second room I found useful was [Buffer Overflow Prep](https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep). It was super nice to practice over it again and again, because there are too many steps, and it is easy to forget if you're not doing a lot of them imo. They also have paths, which are a list of machines that are recommended to do in that style. The Offensive Pentesting path was quite nice and basic actually, but also had some CTFish machines.
