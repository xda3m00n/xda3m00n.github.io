## Overview
In this post I will share my experience with the [Offensive Security Wireless Professional(OSWP)](https://www.offensive-security.com/wifu-oswp/) and provide my thoughts on the certification and some links that could help in that journey. 

## Before OSWP

After finishing the known certification OSCP ([which you can my experience with it](https://xd3m0n.xyz/posts/OSCP-PEN200/)) I decided to continue my journey with [OSWP](https://www.offensive-security.com/wifu-oswp/), mainly because I always found wireless hacking interesting, figured it'd be easier than OSCP and since I had the free time in my hands, I went for it.

## The labs(?) and the course

I signed up for the exam in November 2020. Unlike OSCP, there are no labs to practice on. Instead, you're forced to build your own lab. That means buying the required gear and devices yourself. I had the [Alfa AWUS036NH](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NH-802-11g-Wireless-Long-Range) before rolling into the course and I also had an old router I stopped using a few years ago, which is ``TL-WR841N``. I know it's not what Offsec recommends but I still managed to find it working perfectly fine for a home lab. I was still able to create WEP and WPA networks and used most of the attacks described in the book perfectly fine. 
Offensive Secruity offers a 380-page book and 3.5 hours of instructional videos. Both of them are old, very old. I encountered a time stamp from 2011 in the book. Now that does not mean it's bad. I was fully aware that the course materials are gonna be old. However, it still holds value. It does a great job explaining the insights of wireless security and that's what I needed, to know what happens behind the scenes. Just to mention, some of the attacks explained in the course materials ``could`` still happen today. 

Setting up the home lab was easy, because I didn't really need to do much but head to the router's configuration page and change a few things based on the exercise provided by the book and then attack it. Offsec provides you a Backtrack VM, I persoanlly did not use that and ended up using the latest kali instead.


## The exam 

I believe OSWP's exam must be the easiest of all 6 from Offsec. The exam itself is 4 hours long and not proctored unlike OSCP which is a 24 hour exam and proctored. You initially begin by getting a set of creds to a remote machine hosted by Offsec and you're required to log in using [``SSH``](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh). The machine was hosted way far from where I live and my latency was a little bit high, so it was harder to type in long commands.

In the exam, I was facing three networks with different security protocols, most of them were explained in the course materials. ``The course makes you ready for the exam``. There were a lot of different networks available too, Offsec requires you to focus on the only three you're provided with. There's also a password list file provided in the machine, so no need to use any different password lists like ``rockyou.txt``. I was able to finish the exam in the first two hours and then made sure I collected enough evidence for the report.

## Notes and the Report 
After owning three of the networks, I was given another 24 hours for the report. I made sure to take screenshots of every little thing in the exam, every command and every output that was successfull. I stored them all in [``CherryTree``](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/). Found it very useful because I was able export it as PDF, and then edited it using Word to add headliners etc. The report was around 20 pages, of just screenshots and normal book stuff like content of tables, the way to get the passphrase etc. Apparently it was enough.
